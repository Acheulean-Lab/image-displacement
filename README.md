# image-displacement
Image + pattern displacement  built with Pixi.js

Displacement Mechanics: The displacement is driven by a texture map. Black areas have no effect, while white areas produce maximum offset. This effect works best with high-contrast images. In my version on https://ethan-rubens.com/ a checkerboard style bitmap texture is used, scaled up. 

Includes mouse following on desktop and automatic animation for mobile.
